<p>What is a genre? The Oxford English Dictionary declares it is “a particular type or style of literature, art, film 
or music that you can recognize because of its special features.” That’s an adequate definition, but seems awfully vague. </p>
<p>It’s easy to go too broad or get too granular, so in an attempt to thread that particular needle, here we will define a ‘genre’ 
as a category of stories related by similar narrative structures, themes, and tropes; stories within said category are described 
in such a way as to give a reader a general sense of what to expect from a given piece of media within said genre. </p>


<p>A science fiction novel, for example, could be expected to contain some or all of the following:</p>
<br>-some sort of advanced technology, such as time travel, spaceships, teleportation machines, etc.</br>
<br>-a setting decades or centuries after the time at which it was written</br>
<br>-a setting on a planet other than Earth, and/or feature alien lifeforms</br>

<p>What’s your favorite genre?</p>
